Summarization can be defined as a task of producing a concise and fluent summary while preserving key information and overall meaning. One benefit of this will be, you donâ€™t need to train and build a model prior start using it for your project. Itâ€™s good to understand Cosine similarity to make the best use of the code you are going to see. Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. Its measures cosine of the angle between vectors. The angle will be 0 if sentences are similar.\"\"\"\n","\n","# Tokenizing the text\n","stopWords = set(stopwords.words(\"english\"))\n","words = word_tokenize(text)\n","freqTable = dict()\n","\n","# Creating a frequency table to keep the\n","# score of each word\n","\n","freqTable = dict()\n","for word in words:\n","\tword = word.lower()\n","\tif word in stopWords:\n","\t\tcontinue\n","\tif word in freqTable:\n","\t\tfreqTable[word] += 1\n","\telse:\n","\t\tfreqTable[word] = 1\n","\n","# Creating a dictionary to keep the score\n","# of each sentence\n","sentences = sent_tokenize(text)\n","sentenceValue = dict()\n","\n","for sentence in sentences:\n","\tfor word, freq in freqTable.items():\n","\t\tif word in sentence.lower():\n","\t\t\tif sentence in sentenceValue:\n","\t\t\t\tsentenceValue[sentence] += freq\n","\t\t\telse:\n","\t\t\t\tsentenceValue[sentence] = freq\n","\n","\n","\n","sumValues = 0\n","for sentence in sentenceValue:\n","\tsumValues += sentenceValue[sentence]\n","\n","# Average value of a sentence from the original text\n","\n","average = int(sumValues / len(sentenceValue))\n","\n","# Storing sentences into our summary.\n","summary = ''\n","for sentence in sentences:\n","\tif (sentence in sentenceValue) and (sentenceValue[sentence] > (1.2 * average)):\n","\t\tsummary += \" \" + sentence\n","print(summary)\n"]}]}
